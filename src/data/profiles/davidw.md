In 2007, I started teaching myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. That decision changed my life forever.

👋 Who I Am

Hi, I’m David. I help software engineers lead and grow by elevating their people skills.

By day, I’m a Lead Software Engineer. By night, I’m a solopreneur working on my side business.

💻 What I Do

I’ve always been fascinated by frontend development and UX. I love building delightful user interfaces and today work mostly with React, TypeScript, and GraphQL.

As a leader, I focus on supporting others and motivating them to do great work. Being an engineering leader lets me use my experience to help others grow—not just as software engineers, but as humans too.

🚀 My Side Business

In 2024, I launched Made by DW. Right now, I’m focused on:

- Writing my weekly newsletter, Besides Code
- Building digital products
- Offering 1:1 coaching
